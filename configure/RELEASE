# RELEASE - Location of external support modules
#
# IF YOU CHANGE ANY PATHS in this file or make API changes to
# any modules it refers to, you should do a "make rebuild" in
# this application's top level directory.
#
# The EPICS build process does not check dependencies against
# any files from outside the application, so it is safest to
# rebuild it completely if any modules it depends on change.
#
# Host- or target-specific settings can be given in files named
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).Common
#  RELEASE.Common.$(T_A)
#  RELEASE.$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH).$(T_A)
#
# This file is parsed by both GNUmake and an EPICS Perl script,
# so it may ONLY contain definititions of paths to other support
# modules, variable definitions that are used in module paths,
# and include statements that pull in other RELEASE files.
# Variables may be used before their values have been set.
# Build variables that are NOT used in paths should be set in
# the CONFIG_SITE file.

# Variables and paths to dependent modules:
MODULES = /data/epics/modules
#MYMODULE = $(MODULES)/my-module

# If any motor controller communication mechanism besides 
# the VME backplane is required, then ASYN must be defined.
# Recommended ASYN release: R4-35
ASYN=$(MODULES)/asyn

# If using the sequencer, point SNCSEQ at its top directory:
SNCSEQ = $(MODULES)/seq-2.2.8

# Recommended BUSY release: R1-7-1
#!BUSY=$(MODULES)/busy

# Recommended MOTOR release: R7-2-1
MOTOR=$(MODULES)/motor

# The following must be defined for motorMXmotor
#!MX=$(MODULES)/mx/mx

# IPAC is required to build motorHytec
# Recommended IPAC release: R2-15
#!IPAC=$(MODULES)/ipac-R2-15

# Script module needed to build motorScriptMotor
#!LUA=$(MODULES)/lua-R1-3

# Modbus module needed to build motorAMCI's example IOC
# Required MODBUS release: R2-11 or later
#!MODBUS=$(MODULES)/modbus-R3-0

# EPICS_BASE should appear last so earlier modules can override stuff:
EPICS_BASE = /data/epics/base

# Set RULES here if you want to use build rules from somewhere
# other than EPICS_BASE:
#RULES = $(MODULES)/build-rules

# These lines allow developers to override these RELEASE settings
# without having to modify this file directly.
